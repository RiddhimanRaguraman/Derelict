## Game Mechanics

### Premise

The player is stranded alone on an island and must explore to find a way to escape. Engage in various activities, from escaping bears to shooting, in a continuous game with multiple possibilities.

### Rules of Progression

Each level has different winning conditions, including escaping, shooting, and interacting with other characters. The player starts with a bad health condition, requiring the collection of tokens like water and fruits in the first level. Meeting other characters in level two removes the health condition, replacing it with ammo conditions for weapons.

### Challenge Mechanics

Sublevels become progressively challenging, requiring players to find scenes on their own, overcome limited ammunition, and shoot precisely for disguise. An extra nonplayable character guides the player initially.

## System Requirements

- A PC is required to play the game.
- Controls are keyboard and mouse-based.
- Arrow keys simulate player movement.
- Mouse clicks for shooting.
- Additional gameplay elements yet to be added.
